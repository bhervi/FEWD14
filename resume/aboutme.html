  <h3>What you need to know...</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Kenya but grew-up in Philadelphia, and then moved to Los Angeles in 2009. I am not a dog lover, however an incredibily sweet dog found her way into my life and now I can't imagine life without her. I enjoy traveling, cooking, hiking, reading and watching mindless tv!
